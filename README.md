# Hindi-Language-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning
<h2>How to run the project:</h2>
<h3>.First run the preparedata.py to get different positive and negative sentiment files merge them shuffle them and convert into a single dataframe.<br><br>
.After that run the data_processing.py file to do data preprocessing and split it into train and test.<br><br>
.Now run the custom_embeddings.py file to build cutom embeddings model using fasttext.<br><br>
.Then run the Dictionary_Weight_matrix.py file to build the dictionary and weight_matrix to be used later in embedding_layer.<br><br>
.Finally you run the Neural_Network_train.py to train the model.<br><br>
